# MudaeReact
Simple reaction bot for mudae messages

First you need a token key from some discord bot, look at https://discord.com/developers/applications

Then change the reaction word to your Mudae's language

Example:

For english users:

console.log(str.includes('React'));
if (str.includes('React'))

For portuguese users:

console.log(str.includes('Reaja'));
if (str.includes('Reaja'))

Make the change depending on your language
